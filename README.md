# caesarDecrypt
Python script that accepts an encrypted message and an offset, and decrypts the message using the offset

When the script is run it will ask you if you want the decryption for all offsets or if you want to specify an offset.
  1. If you choose 1, it will show you all the values you could be using offsets 0-25 giving you all possibilities.
  2. If you choose 2, it will ask you to provide an offset and will then only give the output for that one offset.
